# Flower Recognizer
This is my first ML project made using https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ that analyse and classifies flowers into various categories.
### For now the model is only trained to recognize 3 flowers:
  1. Rose
  2. Sunflower
  3. Tulips

## Requirements:
Python(3.8)

## Libraries:
  - tensorflow
  - keras
  - Pillow
  - numpy
